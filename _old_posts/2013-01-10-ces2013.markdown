Hand tracking with a time-of-flight camera. Work with Stan Melax, Sterling Orsten, others.

Working with Stan Melax & Sterling Orsten at Intel, I worked on the development of a unique, novel 3D hand tracking solution that worked in real-time on consumer hardware. It was shown at CES 2013 briefly during the Intel Keynote and [was seen on the show floor (starting at 0:55)](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3851656/intel-perceptual-computing-hands-on-video){:target="_blank"}. Additional samples of it working are available on Stan Melax's YouTube page and embedded below.
