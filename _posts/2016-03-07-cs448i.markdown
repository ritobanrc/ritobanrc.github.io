We introduce various projection functions in the analysis of stereoscopic depth sensors. 

Through these methods, we are able to design stereo systems which are not bound by traditional quadratic depth error. Additionally, we demonstrate how existing correspondence algorithms can be modified to handle these lens designs. In addition, we can construct lens projection models which are more suited to natural lens designs, and build stereo systems with minimal re-sampling errors. This also allows us to construct  wide-angler stereoscopic systems than previously possible, without significant re-sampling or sacrificing accuracy.
