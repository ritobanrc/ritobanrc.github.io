A 3D physically-based path tracing renderer written in Rust; originally based on the "Raytracing in One Weekend" book series, but with several features from the PBR Book impelemented as well. Features multi-threading and BVH acceleration, and supports rendering triangle meshes, HDR environment maps, volumetrics, mathematical primitives like conic sections, procedural textures like Perlin Noise, scenes exported as YAML files, and more!
