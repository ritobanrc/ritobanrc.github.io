We implemented a detection and deformable tracking pipeline for red blood cells. 

 including automated detection with a Hough Circle Transform, and deformable tracking with our own Python implementation of Distance Regularized Level Set Evolution on top of basic image processing primitives provided by Pythonâ€™s scikit-image library (e.g. Gaussian Filters). We analyze the behavior of this tracking system and its shortcomings.
