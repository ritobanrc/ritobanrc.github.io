In discretizations of partial differential equations, diveregence free vector fields are often obtained by solving a linear system, resulting in a discrete approximation of the continuous field that is discretely divergence-free. For many applications, such as tracing particles, this discrete field must then be extended to the entire region using interpolation. In this paper, we construct approximation schemes with the property that discretely divergence-free data interpolates to an analytically divergence-free vector field. Our solution is remarkably simple, compared to previous approaches, being local, piecewise polynomial, and $C^0$ or $C^1$ continuous, even at cell boundaries.
