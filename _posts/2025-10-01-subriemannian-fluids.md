We explore a novel approach to preserving the Hamiltonian structure of ideal fluids: we discretize the _Koopman operator_ of the flow map. Because incompressible fluid flow is described by a volume-preserving diffeomorphism, its Koopman operator is orthogonal. Motivated by this, one might seek to spatially discretize flow maps as orthogonal matrices, and model an ideal fluid by a least action principle on O(n). To make this work, one picks a finite element space for velocities, and because this velocity space is not closed under Lie brackets, the resulting spatially discrete fluid model is non-holonomically constrained. Sub-Riemannian geometry is precisely the study of such systems, and the normal sub-Riemannian geodesic equations yield a natural Hamiltonian structure-preserving discretization.
