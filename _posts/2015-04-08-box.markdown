Using a single depth sensor, real-time detection of cuboids, accurate estimation of their dimensions, and even some bin-packing.

To show that the Intel RealSense cameras were capable of real-time volume measurement. I designed and built an algorithm that decomposed the problem into two parts, a surface-estimation step and a bounding rectangle step. Then, with basic geometry, was able to build a system that estimated object volume, even with only two visible sides. This was further expanded with a configurable-objective [Bin Packing solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem){:target="_blank"} that I wrote. The use of this is that most shipping companies (FedEx, USPS, UPS, DHL, etc.) now are limited (and hence charge), by volume not weight.   


With the help of [Sterling Orsten](https://github.com/sgorsten){:target="_blank"} and [Dimitri Diakopoulos](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos){:target="_blank"}, we put together a compelling visual prototype that was shown by Intel's CEO at IDF 2015 (China).
