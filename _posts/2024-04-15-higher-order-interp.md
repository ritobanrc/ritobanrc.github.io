Building on our prior divergence-free interpolation paper, (1) we design a divergence-free interpolation scheme that preserves the discrete flux, (2) we adapt the general construction of divergence-free fields into a general construction for curl-free fields, (3) we extend the framework to a more general class of finite difference discretizations, and (4) we use this flexibility to construct fourth-order accurate interpolation schemes for the divergence-free case and the curl-free case.
