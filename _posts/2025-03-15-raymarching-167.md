I extended the path tracer that we built at the end of CSE 167 to support ray marching. Ray marching allows one to render any geometry described by a signed distance function (SDF), by taking steps along rays of size determined by the SDF. By constructing repeating SDFs, we can very efficiently render extremely fractals and other types of duplicated geometry, like the Menger Sponge shown on the left.
