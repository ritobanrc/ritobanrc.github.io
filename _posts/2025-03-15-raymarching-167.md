Extends the path tracer from CSE 167 to support ray marching. Ray marching allows one to render any geometry described by a signed distance function (SDF), by taking steps along rays of size determined by the SDF. By constructing repeating SDFs, we can very efficiently render fractals or other duplicated geometries, like the Menger Sponge shown on the left, or manipulate geometry (such as by extruding or rounding corners) simply by processing the SDF.
