Some re-implementations of standard stereo correspondence algorithms, along with experiments using classification for stereo matching. 

In this project, we are exploring the application of machine learning to solving the classical stereoscopic correspondence problem. We present a re-implementation of several state-of-the-art stereo correspondence methods. Additionally, we present new methods, replacing one of the state-of-the-art methods for stereo with a proposed technique based on machine learning methods. These new methods out-perform existing heuristic baselines significantly.
