A React/Typescript web app that displays hiking trails in the San Diego area, and lets users create accounts, create new trails, and write reviews. The backend is implemented as an Express.js server with an SQLite database, using Sequelize as an ORM. The maps are displayed with Leaflet and the OSRM API.
